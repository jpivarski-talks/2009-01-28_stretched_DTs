\frametitle{So, what could it be?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Process of elimination for all rigid body degrees of freedom

\begin{itemize}
\item \sout{$\phi_y$: implausible}
\item \sout{$\Delta R$ (a local $z$ translation): can't reconcile both $r\phi$ and $z$ residuals}
\item local $x$, $y$ translations: can't introduce any linear trends in residuals, only offsets
\item $\phi_z$ rotation: introduces a linear trend in $r\phi$
  residuals vs.\ $z$ and $z$ residuals vs.\ $\phi$, but not what we're
  looking for
\item $\phi_x$ rotation: also would have to be implausibly large, and only affects $z$ residuals (the opposite of what we're looking for)
\end{itemize}

\item Non-rigid degree of freedom \hfill \includegraphics[width=0.35\linewidth]{stretch_explanation.png}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\it some kind} of stretching would easily explain it
\item an error in the geometry description, duplicated by CMSSW, would
  account for its regularity (with outliers due to small individual
  $\Delta R$ misalignments)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Regularity of the effect}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{slopehist.png}

\begin{itemize}
\item Distribution of slopes in $r\phi$ residuals vs.\ $\phi$ (wheels
  $-$1, 0, $+$1) \\ peaks at roughly 10~mm/radian
\item 0 underflows, 1 overflow
\item Small individual $\Delta R$ misalignments can smear this
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Analogy with CSC case}
\begin{itemize}
\item Last year, a similar track-based technique uncovered a 0.8~mm error in CSC widths
\item For the same reasons, chamber stretching was degenerate with increasing the distance from the beamline
\item Degeneracy was resolved with photogrammetry of alignment pins
\begin{itemize}
\item track-based procedure reproduced $r\phi$ positions of alignment pins with 270~$\mu$m accuracy
\item $R$ positions of pins were therefore directly comparable, and constrained distance from the beamline
\end{itemize}
\item CSC geometry experts investigated and quickly found a 10~$\mu$m strip pitch
  angle error, which, compounded over 80~strips, changed the width by
  0.8~mm, explaining the observation with tracks
\item DTs have an advantage over CSCs in that they precisely measure
  $z$ residuals in addition to $r\phi$ residuals, so we can already
  break degeneracy between $\Delta R$ and stretching
\item In the CSC case, we predicted the magnitude but made a mistake in guessing
  the sign: we'd follow up on any effect of this magnitude

\frametitle{Conclusions: what to do?}
\begin{itemize}\setlength{\itemsep}{0.2 cm}
\item I would like to ask DT geometry experts to look for a chamber
  description error on the order of 5~mm across the local $x$
  dimension

\item We have shown that it is a real chamber-level effect and ruled
  out the possibility of it being caused by any rigid chamber misalignment

\item ``Stretching/squashing'' can be interpreted loosely
\begin{itemize}
\item only distortions which affect active elements matter
\item a bulging layer can look narrow (though that's a second-order effect, like $\phi_y$)
\item a $\phi_y$ $\sim$ 70~mrad rotation built into the chamber?
\item a $\Delta R$ misalignment for superlayers 1 and 3 and not superlayer 2 could explain the incompatibility of $r\phi$ and $z$ residuals
\item it's hard to imagine timing effects playing a role, since left- and right-hand sides of each wire would be affected oppositely
\item \ldots
\end{itemize}

\item Since it's causing $\pm 2.5$~mm unbiased residuals errors at the ends of
  the chambers, it's as important for resolution as alignment
